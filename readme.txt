Version 2 of this library of functions. This library contains useful functions for working with, filtering, plotting and exporting water-level well data. To see how it works, have a look in the scripts folder at one of the scripts starting 'example'. 

The core functions, which do the bulk of the filtering, plotting etc are in the 'functions' folder. Typically, you should write scripts which stitch together multiple functions in the 'scripts' folder. The latest EWM/CASGEM database data should be maintained in 'opendata_files'; the function import_data automatically updates this if run from within the scripts folder. A selection of useful (and less useful) CV related polygons are contained in 'polygons'. Some deprecated functions are also in the 'deprecated' subfolder. 'old_temp' is typically for things I don't need any more but am too scared to delete. Good luck!
