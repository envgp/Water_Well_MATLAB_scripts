function [KMZFullFile] = kml2kmz(varargin)
%kml2kmz converts .kml file types into self-contained .kmz filetypes.
%   ML: this is a 98% Ryan Bell's script, and 2% mine. I fiddled with his
%   code a bit to make the bit which searches for images work correctly. It
%   takes a '.kml' filename and, in return, creates a new file with the
%   same name but a '.kmz' ending which should, incredibly, work! Ryan
%   Bell's original documentation follows.
%
%
%   kml2kmz(KMLFullFile) copies all the support documents used by the kml 
%   into a single 'files' folder, and updates the file path in the kml to
%   the new relative path accordingly.  The kml is also copied, then zipped
%   up with the new copies of supporting files.  The zip file is then 
%   renamed with a .kmz extension, and put in the same folder as the 
%   original kml.  The new copies of supporting documents are then deleted 
%   by default.  Supporting documents referenced by KML attributes are not yet
%   supported.
% 
%   kml2kmz(KMLFullFile,'keepsupportfiles') keeps the extra copies of the 
%   supporting documents.
%
%   kml2kmz(KMLFullFile, 'deleteoriginalkml') deletes the original kml. 
% 
%   Both 'keepsupportfiles' and 'deleteoriginalkml' can be used at the same time.

%
%   Still to be Considered: Please contact me if you can help me solve these
%   questions/points.
%       1:  Currently checks for addresses in kml elements, but we need to deal with
%       the kml attribute case too.  I don't have an example to work with.
%       2:  Haven't checked fucntionality on Linux or Mac, but should work
%       as far as I know
%       3:  Haven't checked if ".." notation is handled properly
%       4:  I haven't worked with Alias' before.  Are Targethref and
%       Sourcehref handled properly?
%       5:  Are there other element types I've missed?

%   Version 2.1, December 05, 2012
%
%
%   version 1.0  - intial coding
%   version 2.0  - added internet file download
%                - added check to prevent downloading same file twice
%                - added check to ensure file names don't conflict
%                - removed platform check
%                - added <a href> to catch description text
%                - improved description text and added a todo list
%   version 2.1  - added conditional check for existing, but empty, elements
