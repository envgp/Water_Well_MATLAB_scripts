Info on Tim Nicely data from meeting him in person on Nov 13th 2019.

This data comes from a collection of sources. 

"Aquifer" column refers to the aquifer system the well measurement refers to, where the aquifer systems correspond to their 3-layer Kaweah groundwater model. Options: UNK=unknown, UAS=upper aquifer system, LAS=lower aquifer system,SAS=single aquifer system (which is where you have no C-clay). To assign these they have used perforations but also some hydrographs at 'key wells'. I haven't checked these key wells to see exactly what they look like in the hydrography. 

In the 'source' category you have various things going on. Larry Dotson refers to data collected by Larry, an employee of Kaweah Water Conservation District; Kaweah 2000 refers to data collected for use in an old groundwater model called Kaweah 2000, etc. (I didn't catch the rest of the explanations)

Key wells are used as an indicator of a particular aquifer system, I think.
